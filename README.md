Photon Multiplayer Minigame Assignment:
Importance:
Most of the games and development projects that make it in industry and the private
sector are group efforts, accordingly it is vital you learn to communicate and work
effectively with other developers, managers, testers, and project managers. I will ask you
to try each of these roles even if it is not your preferred role in a group project so that
you have enough empathy, understanding, and experience in this role to work effectively
with others that take that role on for group work. Successful completion of this project
will also enable you to:
- Gain familiarity with using the photon pun 2 plugin and photon api with C# and
unity and gain insight into the mechanics of using api’s for networking.
- Have a theoretical understanding of the implementation of a multiplayer game.
Explanation:
Each group member should complete this tutorial before beginning the assignment:

intro. The assignment is to create a multiplayer minigame with an interesting and
intuitive core game loop using the PUN2 photon plugin and the unity game engine. Each
group member in the Game Design Document you will submit along with a video of
gameplay explain their own reflections on these topics:
- What considerations you must make that are different from single player games
when you design and implement a multiplayer game.
- How multiplayer gameplay changes the nature of a game from a theoretical
perspective.
- How a multiplayer environment might be created where learning could occur, the
nature of that learning, and how you would go about implementing such an
environment.
Within those parameters you are free to create any kind of minigame you wish and
conclude anything you want as long as it is well reasoned, just keep in mind that there is
only about a month of development time for each minigame so curtail your ambitions
accordingly.
I will also look to make sure that:
1. your core game loop is fun, interesting, graphically pleasing, and intuitive (the
artist and tester should be heavily involved in ensuring that this is the case),
2. that your code is well commented, organized and significantly original (the
developer and tester should be heavily involved in ensuring this is the case),
3. and that you use some form of version control so there is ample opportunity for
you to demonstrate your abilities as a group dev and tester.
There are four roles, one for each group member (if your group has more or less than
four contact me and we’ll work something out where a member or a role doubles up).
These are project lead, digital artist, primary developer and secondary tester, and
primary tester and secondary developer. You must indicate who has what role and stick
with those roles for this project, then switch for the next minigame project so that
everyone gets a chance in every role. This should be well documented and easy for me
to look over and understand who was doing what and contributed what in the game
design doc you will submit with your group game, and you should indicate who is
switching to what role for the next group project in a clear way.
Rubrix/Assessment:
Here’s what I’ll look at to determine your grade on this group project (500pts max)
1. Multiplayer implementation code using the photon pun2 plugin
a. Code is well organized and commented so that each major function has an
explanation for what it does. (50pts)
b. Significant amount of the code is original to the group members not copied and
pasted from somewhere. (50pts)
2. A write up of the contributions of all group members and a brief game design document
(50pts possible)
3. Individual group members reflection contributions in the GDD where each member
reflects on the following topics: (100pts - 25pts each)
a. What considerations you must make that are different from single player games
when you design and implement a multiplayer game.
b. How multiplayer gameplay changes the nature of a game from a theoretical
perspective.
c. How a multiplayer environment might be created where learning could occur, the
nature of that learning, and
d. how you would go about implementing such an environment.
4. Your group's philosophical discussion question answers are written up, with individual
group members each having a clearly demarcated opinion or answer to any weekly
discussion questions or philosophical topics we go over in class concerning AI or
networking (40pts possible).
5. Final playable game screencast of gameplay of the core game loop with at least three
people playing the game at once (100pts possible)
6. A write up of who will be the next project lead, artist, primary developer and secondary
tester, and primary tester and secondary developer in the group (everyone must fill each
role once). (40pts possible)
7. Screenshots of some form of version control. (20pts possible)
